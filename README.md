## Brief Description
Problem solving of 
Task1- To find the smallest positive integer that does not occur in Array.
Task2- Finding all the triplets in an array that sums up to target value.

### `Task 1`
  - copy the code from https://github.com/sathiyapriyakm/problem_solving/blob/main/task1.js into any online compiler
  - change the  value of array "arr" to any test value.
  - Run the code in compiler to get desired output.

 ### `Task 2`
  - copy the code from https://github.com/sathiyapriyakm/problem_solving/blob/main/task2.js into any online compiler
  - change the  value of array "arr" and variable "targetSum" to any test value.
  - Run the code in compiler to get desired output.
